# 8-Channel-Arduino-Sequencer

A basic 8 Channel gate sequenser. 
 - Internal or External Clock
 - bufferd gates (0-5V) for each step (to do: Gates should be 10V open)
 - Dwell time, how long the gate is open
 - Trigger output from CLOCK (to do: Trigger should be 10V 1ms)
 - MIDI in as option for CLOCK source
 - Forward and revers steping
 - Reset, Play and Pause buttons (to do: Add reset trigger input)
 - Ping pong stepping

Add CV-card and CV sequenser is born
 - Bufferd CV-out, max voltage is set via multi turn potentiometer (5-7.7V with +9V feed) (to do: CV should be 0-10V or +-5V P to P)
 - Bufferd 5V trigger
